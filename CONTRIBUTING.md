## [](https://github.com/atlascity/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#add-yourself-as-a-contributor)Add yourself as a contributor

This project follows the  [all contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors)  specification. To add yourself to the table of contributors on the README.md, please use the automated script as part of your PR:

yarn contributor <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>

Follow the prompt. If you've already added yourself to the list and are making a new type of contribution, you can run it again and select the added contribution type. If you need to edit the  `.all-contributorsrc`  file by hand that's fine too, just run  `yarn contributor:generate`  to regenerate the table
