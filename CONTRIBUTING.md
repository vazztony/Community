## [](https://github.com/atlascity/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#add-yourself-as-a-contributor)Add yourself as a contributor

This project follows the  [all contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors)  specification. To add yourself to the table of contributors on the README.md, please use the automated script as part of your PR:

yarn contributor <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>

Follow the prompt. If you've already added yourself to the list and are making a new type of contribution, you can run it again and select the added contribution type. If you need to edit the  `.all-contributorsrc`  file by hand that's fine too, just run  `yarn contributor:generate`  to regenerate the table

Please checkout the  [ROADMAP](https://github.com/atlascity/community/blob/master/docs/ROADMAP.md)  and raise an issue to discuss any of the items

# Submitting Bugs and Suggestions

### [](https://github.com/atlascity/community/submitting-bugs-and-suggestions.md#before-submitting-an-issue)Before Submitting an Issue

First, please do a search for open issues in the issue tab to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction. Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment.

üëç - upvote

üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, submit an issue using the guidelines below.

## [](https://github.com/atlascity/community/submitting-bugs-and-suggestions.md#writing-good-bug-reports-and-feature-requests)Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request.

-   Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
-   Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please remember to do the following:

-   Search the issue repository to see if there exists a duplicate.
-   Simplify your code around the issue so we can better isolate the problem.

If you are interested in fixing issues and contributing directly to the code base, please see the section [How to Contribute](https://github.com/atlascity/Community#how-to-contribute).
